# P2PQuickStart
.Net console app example for credit application submission.

This is a basic starting point for partners to send credit application data to our P2P service.

The console app provides a couple quick methods:

PingService:
This is provided as a connection check. It will return the build date if successful. No authentication token is necessary.

PostApplication:
Will return XML response body showing the new app number from our system if successful.
Uncomment when you have an Authentication token and have some XML to test.
Enter the Authentication Token 
Execute
